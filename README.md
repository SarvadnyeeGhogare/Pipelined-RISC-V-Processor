Pipelined Processor

This project implements a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor supporting the RV32I instruction set architecture,designed using Verilog HDL.
The processor features well-defined pipeline stagesâ€”Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback,along with hazard detection and forwarding logic to maintain instruction throughput.
It simulates realistic instruction flow and memory operations, including handling stalls, flushes, and control hazards for branching and data dependencies.
